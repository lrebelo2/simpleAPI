This is an extremely simple API using Spring and SpringBoot

It is literally the project on the Getting Started Page of spring.io, but
adds some functionality and robustness 
(in the near future if you are seeing this as I uploaded it, and if so you spend too 
 much time on GitHub)


It returns as a response a request id, a greeting message with optional input parameter
and the time of the request.
If the war is run, the server and port should default to localhost:8080.
You can run it via java -jar simpleAPI.war, or mvn spring-boot:run if you have maven isntalled

Example:

	request-
		http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=Lucas

	response-
		{
		  "id" : 1,
		  "content" : "Hello Lucas!",
		  "time" : "21:43:59.805"
		}
Usage:
	
	<server>/greeting
	<server>/greeting?name=User // adds custom user name to response body

Yeah. That's all, sorry. =)


Although it is very simple, there's some neat good practice features (hopefully):

- 100% Java implemented leveraging the Spring Framework, 
  packaged as a war to run on a compatible server/jvm. 

- Auto indent on the response body

- Custom error redirecting page (just a simple message explaining usage)
